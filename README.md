# Follower: Follow twitter users anonymously

This tool simply keeps a tracking list and allows you to follow those people's
Twitter feeds without actually visiting the site or becoming a twitter user. Of
course it requires the feeds to be public.

I am not maintaining this anymore so it might be incompatible with the changes
in the Twitter API.
